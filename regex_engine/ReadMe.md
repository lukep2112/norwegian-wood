#  Implementing a Regular Expression Engine 

This project takes in a regular expression, checks for correctness, and then generates the corresponding NFA in python. The user is then able to check words against the implemented NFA to see if the word is part of the language. 

## Getting Started

To run this program simply open a command line and in the directory containing the .py file type the command "python project1.py" and the program should run!


### Prerequisites

The latest version of python2. On my machine I am running 2.7.14. 

## Running the tests

To run the code simply enter your regular expression in the command line when prompted.

If the regular expression is invalid, the program will print out a message insulting your choice of regular expression.

If the regular expression is valid, the program will then prompt you to enter a word for testing. 

If the word passes the program will print out a "Yes :)" and if the word fails the program will print out a "No :("
